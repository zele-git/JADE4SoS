# JADE4SoS
JADE-based software module to model and simulate collaborative works 

This work is motivated by the unique characteristics of SoS, and the inherent challenges associated with those characteristics when designing and developing SoS systems. The goals of a SoS are to achieve collaborative work by leveraging the capabilities of autonomous systems. CSs are faced with the challenge of balancing actions for local goals with goals at the SoS level.
