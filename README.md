# JADE4SoS
JADE-based software module to model and simulate collaborative works 

This work is motivated by the unique characteristics of SoS, and the inherent challenges associated with those characteristics when designing and developing SoS systems. One of the goals of a SoS is to achieve collaborative work by leveraging the capabilities of heterogenous systems.
